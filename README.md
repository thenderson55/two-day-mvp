## Two-day MVP 

This was created over two-days while as a student at Code Chrysalis, Tokyo, Japan.
The assigment was to create an MVP using at least one new tech feature.  🇯🇵  🏯 🗼

## Tokyo Monthly

I created this app in response to Airbnb and other hosting sites in Tokyo delisting all listings without a license, regardless if they were renting out long-term or not.
A license is not needed for bookings of 30 days or more. Currently there aren't many affordable choices for central Tokyo so I would like to make that choice an option.
